Data for the project are voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and the general public. The data collected is actively maintained by the contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the US solar power market. Data Collection. The Open PV Project is collecting data from any willing contributor of available information. NREL has \"seeded\" the Open PV database by requesting data from most state run incentive programs, large utilities, and other organizations. This initial data collection has provided a solid base of data for the project to launch from and it is our hope that the database will continue to grow through contributions from the PV community and anyone interested in understanding PV market dynamics in the US.  Data Quality. Determining the quality of incoming data is dependent upon who is submitting the data to the project. This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be \"trusted\" more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default \"score\" based on their organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Government users (State, Federal, etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry), and so on. All users who contribute data to the project have the ability to gain a \"project reputation\" that can impact the score of the data they contribute.  Validation.  Data validation occurs on each record in the database on a regular basis. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records, bad or invalid data, and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and are dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of the Open PV Team.  Duplication.  Understanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database, it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected, they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into \"summary records\" of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database, the more trust the project places on the data for that installation.  Data Fields. Required Fields. The Open PV Project is designed to be able to store nearly any type of information pertaining to PV installations. In order to provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These four fields are:  -  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date) -  Size/Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC) -  Location (Zipcode or Street Address) -  Total Installed Cost (in USD, before incentives). Additional Fields. The four required fields listed above provide the Open PV Project with the base information needed to derive several key statistics on the US PV market, including historical trends and regional comparisons. However, the design of the Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation, so the Open PV Team would like to encourage you to contribute any additional information you are comfortable sharing. This extra information can be extremely valuable, for example, data that contains information about who installed the PV installation can help to answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Information on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency and detailed financing information can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. The Open PV Team strongly encourages you to contribute any data you feel comfortable providing, especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery someday.","DOE","restricted public",null,"R/PT1S"],["Yucca Mountain License Support Network (LSN)","DOE has preserved its Licensing Support Network (LSN) Collection of some 3.6 million documents and over 30 million pages relevant to the Yucca Mountain licensing proceeding.

It contains data for the tracking, trending and monitoring of accreditation and certification of facilities participating in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Mammography Program. Information is obtained from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture Decision Support System (DSS) Radiology extracts. This information details how often mammography is performed and in which facility and VISN, based from Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code nomenclature. Specific items include, but are not limited to: CPT code(s); medical facility; date of procedure(s); types of imaging procedure(s) and/or biopsy(ies) performed and the facility performing the procedure(s). While the American College of Radiology (ACR) is the primary accrediting institution for all mammography suites in the country, it is the sole accrediting institution for the VHA mammography sites. The ACR independently gathers information from all VAMCs with on-site mammography and sends information weekly to the MQS VA. Forty-five VHA sites are accredited and certified. The ACR uses the information to determine clinical image quality, standards compliance, equipment functional parameters, etc. as a basis for awarding accreditation. The MQS VA data is used to monitor the equipment performance, staff Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) requirements. Accreditation requires the review of clinical images, staff credentials, phantom image assessment, etc. triennially with annual updates. Certification, on the other hand, requires the facility to maintain accreditation, obtain an annual medical physicist survey of mammography equipment and undergo an annual inspection conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The MQS VA data allows the Diagnostic Services, National Radiology Program, which certifies mammography facilities, to notify the VAMCs when their performance reaches levels that may cause substandard images resulting in the potential loss of accreditation and certification. An enhancement to the database has been implemented that adds the results from the annual on-site FDA inspections of VAMC mammography suites. The FDA will send to MQS VA the inspection/test results and the results are added to the database.

Unfortunately, clozapine may also affect portions of the blood, lowering the body's resistance to infection and sometimes creating life-threatening circumstances. Realizing the severity of the problem, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established guidelines for analysis of White Blood Cells and Neutrophils and set strict minimum limits. The FDA also mandated that any manufacturer of clozapine must maintain a Clozapine Registry. These registries are to track the location and the health of clozapine patients and to ensure 'weekly White Blood Cell testing prior to delivery of the next week's supply of medication'. To date, the clozapine manufacturer registries have been unable to develop sufficient controls to meet these requirements, especially the ability to prevent dispensing clozapine when blood results are abnormal. However, because of the unique structure of Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, the Veterans Health Administration obtained permission from the FDA and clozapine manufacturers to use its in-place computer network to gather and evaluate weekly patient information, then export this data to manufacturer clozapine registries.

Weekly data on each VA clozapine patient is processed at two locations.

The software allows the user to set up and define a team, assign positions to the team, assign staff to the positions, assign patients to the team, and assign patients to a Primary Care Provider (PCP) or Associate Provider (AP).  In a Primary Care setting, patients are assigned a PCP, Associate Provider (AP) and/or a Transition Patient Advocate (TPA) who is responsible for delivering essential health care, coordinating all health care services, and serving as the point of access for specialty care.  The PCP is supported by a team of professionals which may include nurses, pharmacists, social workers, etc.  Associate Providers are non-physician clinicians (such as Physicians Assistants, Nurse Practitioners or Residents) who may provide care under the supervision of a presiding PCP.  The PCMM software is considered to be an important component to measure patient demand and the PCPs capacity to meet that demand and to reduce wait times. PCMM was developed to assist facilities in implementing primary care for veterans.  It uses the site's data to identify patients and to assign them to a PCP.

This dataset was derived from 2000 census data and based on the criteria setforth in the Region 2 Interim Environmental Justice Policy.  The two criteria for Region 2's EJ demographic analysis are percent poverty and percent minority.  The percent minority and percent poverty numbers for each blockgroup are compared to the benchmark value for the state.  Census blockgroups with percent poverty or percent minority  higher than the state threshold are considered potential EJ areas.  The cutoffs for each state were derived by using the statistical method - cluster analysis.\n\nCluster analysis was chosen as the most objective way of evaluating the demographic data and determining cutoff values for minority and low income. With cluster analysis, data are divided into two distinct groups (e.g., minority and non-minority, and low income and non-low income). Cluster analysis examines natural breaks of the data. Separate analyses were conducted for minority and low income, respectively, for each State.  All census block groups within a State were ranked in descending order according to the demographic factor under evaluation.  This resulted in a ranking for percent minority by block group and a separate ranking for percent low income by block group.  An iterative process was employed where the data were (1) split into two groups; (2) the means for each of the two groups were calculated; (3) the difference between the means for each group was determined; and (4) Steps 1- 3 were repeated until the greatest difference between the means was found.  This method results in dividing the data into two groups that are as different as possible.\n\nAll of the statistical methods evaluated indicated that minority populations in urban areas were skewing the results for the states of New York and New Jersey.  Specifically, state-wide benchmarks were similar to those derived from using only urban areas, while the results for only rural areas were considerably lowered.  Consequently,  minority data was evaluated separately for urban and rural areas within these states.
